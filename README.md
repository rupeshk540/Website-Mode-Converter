# Website-Mode-Converter
This repository hosts the code for a Website Mode Converter project implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Website Mode Converter allows users to switch between light mode and dark mode on a website, providing a customizable and comfortable viewing experience based on user preferences.

Features
Light Mode and Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light mode and dark mode to adjust the appearance of the website according to their preference and reduce eye strain, especially in low-light conditions.
User Preferences: The Website Mode Converter saves the user's mode preference locally, allowing the chosen mode to persist across different pages and sessions.
Smooth Transition: The transition between light mode and dark mode is designed to be smooth and visually appealing, providing a seamless user experience.
